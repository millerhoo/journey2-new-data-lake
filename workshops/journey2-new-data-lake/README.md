# Big Data Journey: New Data Lake Workshop
Oracle offers a set of Big Data Journeys to help users get started using Oracle Cloud services with a purpose. This particular journey is designed to show you techniques you can use as part of the **New Data Lake**.

You will learn how to populate and analyze your data lake based on Object Storage from a variety of file and streaming sources. You will also learn how to execute real-time and batch processing with Oracle’s managed Spark and Kafka cloud services.

## Goals
