The \"swift\" command line is written in Python and we will use the pip utility to install it.\n\nYou can find more details about the swift command line tool here: <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/cli.html>\n","dateUpdated":"2017-07-28T00:43:26+0000","config":{"editorSetting":{"editOnDblClick":"true","language":"markdown"},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h1>Installing the swift object store command line utility</h1>\n<p>Next, we will install the &ldquo;swift&rdquo; command line tool.
