# Cleanup Instructions

If you are done with these labs, you might consider stopping your BDCS-CE and OEHCS instances (do so from the My Services page for BDSC-CE and OEHCS respectively).

This will stop OCPU-based charges against your account (you will still be charged for storage used).  You can restart stopped instances at a later time if desired.

Or you can delete the BDCS-CE and OEHCS instances to permanently destroy them and the storage dedicated to them.
